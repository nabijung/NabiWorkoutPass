# WorkoutPass
You are an iOS developer working for a fitness company.  The company wants to be able to display a list of all their available studios/classes on an app.

Part 1:

The first phase of the app must be in a grid layout that displays the following:

1. The studio/class name
2. The instructor
3. The cost of the class
4. Number of seats remaining

You will need to add a collection view and table view into the storyboard and customize the rows and cells accordingly (See assignment from last week for assistance).

Part 2:

You will need to setup the Workout class under Model folder.  Once that is done, use the CSV in this repo to create instances of Workout class and add them to the `workouts` array.

Part 3:

Implement the same toggling functionality in the navigation bar (similar to last weeks assignment) and display the different workouts on the app.
